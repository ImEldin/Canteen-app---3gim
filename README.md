# Canteen App

## Overview
The Third Gymnasium’s canteen faces a recurring problem of food shortages during the big break because staff have no reliable insight into how many students plan to purchase meals. Canteen App plans to solve this by allowing students to mark their meal choices in advance, giving the canteen an accurate estimate of daily demand. This lightweight server-rendered web application provides a simple overview of expected meal quantities and helps prevent shortages through better planning.
